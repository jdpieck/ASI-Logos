# ASI_Logos
Hello! My name is Jason Daniel Pieck, and I am the creator of logo for the [Aggie Space Initiative at UC Davis](https://www.asidavis.org/). Please read the information below to learn more about logo use and check out [license](LICENSE.txt) for legal information.

If you would like to just see the renders, jump down to the section titled [Icon Previews](#icon-previews).

If you would like more renders, a different configuration of the logo, or anything else, you are more than welcome to reach out to me over Discord or email. You are also welcome to make an `Issue` on this GitHub Repository.

# Instructions for Use 
This logo has been designed with several use cases in mind. Please consult the sections below to help determine which logo file you should use.
## Icon or Title Card Selection
### Use the *icon* for...
- social media profile pictures (without cropping)
- website icons
- in the corner of ASI branded materials

### Use the *Title Card* for...
- website headers
- document headers
- posters and banners

## Color Selection
### Logo Color
**When ever possible, use the colored version of the logo**. This is intended to be the primary brand image of ASI, and should be treated as such.

The black logo should be used on printouts with lightly colored backgrounds (including white) and in conjunction with black text. 

The white logo should be used in the cases where the colors of the colored logo are inappropriate, but there is a darkly colored background. 

### Background color 
If you are using the logo for a social media profile picture, make sure to include the colored background marked as `Color-on-Dark` in the file name. This is to ensure visibility across apps in both light and darks modes.

In all other cases, please use the logo with a clear background. 

## Size Selection
When ever possible, try to use the image with the largest resolution possible. This will reduce the chances of the logo appearing "pixilated".

If you are uploading the logo to a website for an icon, they will often specify the ideal size of the icon. For example, the ideal size of a Discord Server Icon is 512px by 512px which would align with the `Medium` sized logos.
